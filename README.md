# DS_HashMap_Portfolio
Redid my Hash Map Portfolio project to refresh and optimize from my first submission when I took the class, can optimize further with new methods learned.

Includes 3 files. The first file a6_include.py was the professors helper data structures (linnked list and dynamic array), although these had to be completed individually in the beginning of the course, mine are contained in the private
Data_Structures repository in my GitHub.

The second file hash_map.oa.py is my updated rework of the implementation after the class ended, to refresh my knowledge on data structures. This file implements a hashmap using open addressing (quadratic probing method)

The third file hash_map_sc.py is my updated rework of the implementation after the class ended, to refresh my knowledge on data structures. This file implements a hashmap using chaining (storing linked lists in the dynamic array indices to avoid collisions)
